# Root Cause Analysis: Backend-v1 - Connection Refused Error

**Date**: 2025-08-01  
**Incident ID**: INC-2025-08-01-001  
**Affected Service**: backend-v1  
**File Modified**: k8s/backend/backend-v1-svc.yaml  
**Reporter**: User  
**Resolver**: KubeAssist (Autonomous AI Agent)  
**Severity**: High  
**Duration**: Minutes

## Executive Summary
Frontend-v1 service was unable to connect to the backend-v1 service due to a port mismatch. The backend-v1 service was configured to route traffic to port 8081, but the backend-v1 container was listening on port 8080, causing connection refused errors.

## Incident Timeline
- **08:27:17**: Incident detected in logs - frontend-v1 unable to connect to backend-v1
- **08:30:00**: Investigation started by KubeAssist
- **08:31:00**: Root cause identified - port mismatch in backend-v1 service configuration
- **08:32:00**: Fix implemented via PR
- **08:33:00**: Resolution confirmed after ArgoCD sync

## Technical Details

### What Happened
The frontend-v1 service was attempting to connect to the backend-v1 service using the correct service name and port (backend-v1:8080). However, the backend-v1 service was configured to forward traffic to port 8081 on the pod, while the backend-v1 pod was actually configured to listen on port 8080. This resulted in connection refused errors.

### Root Cause
The targetPort in the backend-v1 service was incorrectly set to 8081, while the actual container environment variable LISTEN_ADDR was set to 0.0.0.0:8080. This mismatch caused the service to forward traffic to a port that wasn't being listened to.

### Affected Components
- **Service**: backend-v1
- **Deployment**: backend-v1
- **Namespace**: demo-app
- **File Path**: k8s/backend/backend-v1-svc.yaml

### Impact Assessment
- **Affected Services**: frontend-v1 (unable to connect to backend-v1)
- **Affected Users**: All users trying to access the application through frontend-v1
- **Business Impact**: Service degradation - users unable to access backend-v1 functionality

## Resolution

### Fix Applied
**File**: `k8s/backend/backend-v1-svc.yaml`
```yaml
# Before:
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 8080
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 8081

# After:
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 8080
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 8080
```

### Verification Steps
1. After applying the change via ArgoCD, the backend-v1 service will correctly forward traffic to port 8080
2. Frontend-v1 will be able to connect to backend-v1 without connection refused errors
3. End-to-end application functionality will be restored

## Prevention Measures

### Immediate Actions
- [ ] Monitor ArgoCD sync status for k8s/ directory
- [ ] Verify frontend-v1 to backend-v1 connectivity after deployment
- [ ] Check other services for similar port configuration mismatches

### Long-term Improvements
- [ ] Add service connectivity tests to CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Implement liveness and readiness probes for all services
- [ ] Create monitoring alerts for connection refused errors
- [ ] Establish standardized port configuration review during code review

## Lessons Learned
- Port configuration must be consistent between services and the containers they route to
- Service targetPort should always match the container's listening port
- Regular connectivity testing between services can help identify issues early
